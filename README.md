I used Retail customer data for "Customer personality analysis".The Retail customer data was cleaned in Excel by removing duplicates, correcting errors and spellings, standardizing date formats, and handling missing values by filling with "Unknown" or average income. Text cases were formatted properly using upper and lower case, and the TRIM function was used to remove extra spaces for exact spacing between data. Excel tools like AVERAGE, FIND, and REPLACE were also used for efficientÂ transformation.
